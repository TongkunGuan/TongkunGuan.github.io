Hey, I am Tongkun Guan (官同坤). I’m a PhD student of computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, supervised by Dr. Xiaokang Yang and Dr. Wei Shen and this is my first year.

Recently, I am interested in these areas:

- Self-supervised Text Recognition
- End-to-end Text Detection
- Representation Learning
