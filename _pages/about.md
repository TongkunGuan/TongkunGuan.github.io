Hey, I am Tongkun Guan (官同坤). I’m a PhD student of computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, supervised by Dr. Xiaokang Yang and Dr. Wei Shen and this is my first year.

Recently, I am interested in these areas:

- Self-supervised Text Recognition
- End-to-end Text Detection
- Representation Learning

**Education Experience**
=== 
- **2023/04 - now** I am pursuing my PhD degree at Artificial Intelligience Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学, SJTU), Shanghai, China. Supervisor: Dr. Xiaokang Yang and Dr. Wei Shen.

- **2020/09 - 2023/03** I received the M.S. degree in the Department of Automation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University(上海交通大学, SJTU), Shanghai, China, with the National Scholarship! Supervisor: Dr. Chaochen Gu.

- **2016/09 - 2020/06** I received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation (双一流学科) from Hunan University (湖南大学, 985), Changsha, China, with the highest rank (1/259)! Supervisor: Dr. Min Liu.

<!--Tongkun Guan received the M.S. degree in the Department of Automation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2023.
